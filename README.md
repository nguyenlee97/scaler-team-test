# Scaler Team Test - Hotel Reservation System

# Installation

Make sure you have Node and Typescript install globally on your computer

```
npm i
```

# How to use

- To start the project:

```
npm run start
```

- There will be some option on the CLI to choose: Input 1 to start booking room or input 2 to exit.

- To edit the room info (price, number of rooms), please edit the roomInfo.json

- In case you don't have Typescript, I provide a compiled Javascript for you to run directly with NodeJs:

```
node hotelReservation.js
```
